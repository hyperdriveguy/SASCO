# Overview

This is a small demo made in Godot 4 that showcases top-down 2D adventure where the only thing to do is talk to a cactus and walk out of bounds.

Thrilling.

However, I didn't make this for stunning gameplay. I made it for my own growth so that I could learn the Godot game engine.
I learned the ropes of GDScript. I am particularly impressed by the native vector types and intuitive language.

The game is simple to play: use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to interact when an indicator shows above the character's head.

# Development Environment

The develoment environment included Godot's builtin editing tools.
For creating images, Libresprite was used.
For documentation, the code editor Kate was used.
The game is written in GDScript, Godot's own programming language.
